Springboard Target creates and manages custom targets for use in Springboard Actions.

The targets are saved remotely on the Springboard Advocacy API server. A valid, configured
API account is required. The API account configuration is handled by the Springboard Advocacy module.

A default view is provided for an administrative list of targets.

Create and Edit forms are provided by the files in "includes", and the
functions that call the API server are located there as well.

This module is a dependency of SBA Message Action and SBA Message modules. It has no standalone
purpose other than to create, edit and list targets for other modules to use.
