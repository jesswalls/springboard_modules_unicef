Springboard Advocacy Quicksign allows returning, non-logged-in site visitors to submit
a complex webform using only their email address. If there is a existing
user profile for the email address, the user profile details are applied
to the webform, and if all required webform fields have values, the webform is submitted.
If required fields are missing, the visitor is prompted to complete the missing fields.

Quicksign settings are handled per node, and configuration options
will appear on the node/add and node/edit forms for each eligible node.
Once enabled, the quicksign form will appear as a new fieldset containing an
email address textfield and submit button on the user-facing webform. The fieldset title
and description are editable in the per node settings, as is the submit button text.

Currently, the quicksign feature is available for the Springboard Petition and the Springboard
Message Action content types.
