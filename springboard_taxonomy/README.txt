Springboard Taxonomy creates an "Organization issues" vocabulary
and a field api base taxonomy field "field_sba_organization_issues".

After enabling the module, field instances can be added to webform node types
by visiting 'admin/config/content/springboard-taxonomy'.

On that page, checkboxes for each eligible form type are found.
When checked and saved, a field instance is created for the node type.
By default, the taxonomy term field is hidden during node view.

When adding/editing content, the field's taxonomy term options appear
in the vertical tabs fieldset, on the Organization issues tab.

This module is a dependency of the Springboard Message Actions module, and will be
enabled automatically if that module is enabled.
